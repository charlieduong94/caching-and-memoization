<h2 id="what-is-caching">What Is Caching?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Caching is the term for storing reusable responses in order to make subsequent requests faster.</li>
<li>There are different types of caching available.</li>
<li>Application caches and memory caches are both popular for their ability to speed up certain responses.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="types-of-cache">Types of Cache</h2>
<ol>
<li>Disk cache: The page cache in main memory is managed by the operating system kernel.</li>
<li>Web cache</li>
<li>Memoization<ol>
<li>A cache can store data that is computed on demand rather than retrieved from a backing store.</li>
<li>Memoization is an optimization technique that stores the results of resource-consuming function calls within a lookup table, allowing subsequent calls to reuse the stored results and avoid repeated computation.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="web-caching">Web Caching</h2>
<p>Web caching is a core design feature of the HTTP protocol</p>
<pre><code>* It is meant to minimize network traffic while improving perceived responsiveness of the system as a whole.
</code></pre><p>Caches are found at every level of a content&apos;s journey from the original server to the browser.</p>
<p>Web caching works by caching the HTTP responses for requests according to certain rules.</p>
<p>Subsequent requests for cached content can then be fulfilled from a cache closer to the user instead of sending the request all the way back to the web server.</p>
<h2 id="benefits">Benefits</h2>
<p>Effective caching aids both content consumers and content providers.</p>
<p>Some of the benefits that caching brings to content delivery are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Decreased network costs: Content can be cached at various points in the network path between the content consumer and content origin.</p>
</li>
<li><p>When the content is cached closer to the consumer, requests will not add network latency</p>
</li>
<li>Improved responsiveness: Caching enables content to be retrieved faster because an entire network round trip is not necessary.</li>
<li>Caches maintained close to the user, like the browser cache, can make this retrieval nearly instantaneous.</li>
<li>Increased performance on the same hardware<ul>
<li>For the server where the content originated, more performance can be squeezed from the same hardware by allowing aggressive caching.</li>
<li>The content owner can leverage the powerful servers along the delivery path to take the brunt of certain content loads.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Availability of content during network interruptions</li>
<li>Certain caches can be used to serve content even when if unavailable for short periods of time from the origin</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="terminology">Terminology</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Origin server: The origin server is the original location of the content.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you are acting as the web server administrator, this is the machine that you control.</li>
<li>It is responsible for serving any content that could not be retrieved from a cache along the request route</li>
<li>Setting the caching policy for all content.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Cache hit ratio: A cache&apos;s effectiveness is measured in terms of its cache hit ratio or hit rate.</p>
<ul>
<li>This is a ratio of the requests able to be retrieved from a cache to the total requests made.</li>
<li>A high cache hit ratio means that a high percentage of the content was able to be retrieved from the cache.  * This is usually the desired outcome for most administrators.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Freshness: Term used to describe whether an item in cache is considered a candidate to serve to a client.</p>
<ul>
<li>Content in a cache will only be used to respond if it is within the freshness time frame specified by the caching policy.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Stale content: Items in the cache expire according to the cache freshness settings in the caching policy.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Expired content is &quot;stale&quot;.</p>
<ul>
<li>Expired content cannot be used to respond to client requests. The origin server must be re-contacted to retrieve the new content or at least verify that the cached content is still accurate.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Validation: Stale items in the cache can be validated in order to refresh their expiration time.</p>
<ul>
<li>Validation involves checking with the origin server to see if cached content is still up to date</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Invalidation: Invalidation is the process of removing content from the cache before its expiration date.</p>
<ul>
<li>Triggered if the item is changed on the origin server and an outdated item in cache causes client issues</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="cacheable-content">Cacheable Content</h2>
<p>Items that don&apos;t tend to change frequently are good candidates for caching.</p>
<p>Cache Friendly Content:</p>
<ul>
<li>Logos and brand images</li>
<li>Nav Icons</li>
<li>Style sheets</li>
<li>Javascript files</li>
<li>Downloadable Content</li>
<li>Media Files</li>
</ul>
<p>More volatile items to cache:</p>
<ul>
<li>HTML pages</li>
<li>Rotating images</li>
<li>Heavily modified JavaScript and CSS files</li>
<li>Content tied to auth (Cookies, Tokens, etc)</li>
</ul>
<p>Some items that should almost never be cached are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sensitive Dat (banking info, social security numbers, credit card numbers)</li>
<li>user specific information that can change</li>
</ul>
<p>Web Content Cache Locations:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Browser cache: Web browsers themselves maintain a small cache.</p>
<ul>
<li>Browsers sets a policy that dictates the most important items to cache.</li>
<li>This may be user-specific content or content deemed expensive to download and likely to be requested again.</li>
<li>We will explore IndexDb and Local Storage</li>
<li>In memory caching as well</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Intermediary caching proxies: Any server in between the client and infrastructure can cache certain content.</p>
<ul>
<li>These caches may be maintained by ISPs or other independent parties.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Reverse Cache: Your server infrastructure can implement its own cache for backend services.</p>
<ul>
<li>Content can be served from the point of contact instead of hitting backend servers on each request.<ul>
<li>For example hitting a database for each route that has cacheable content</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="caching-http-headers">Caching HTTP Headers</h2>
<p>Caching policy is dependent upon two different factors:</p>
<ol>
<li>The caching entity itself gets to decide whether or not to cache acceptable content.</li>
<li>It can decide to cache less than it is allowed to cache, but never more.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>The majority of caching behavior is determined by the caching policy, which is set by the content owner.</strong></p>
<p>These policies are mainly exercises through the use of specific HTTP headers.</p>
<p>Cache-focused HTTP Headers:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Expires: The Expires header is very straight-forward, although fairly limited in scope.</p>
<ul>
<li>Set a time in the future when the content will expire.</li>
<li>At this point, any requests for the same content will have to go back to the origin server.</li>
<li>This header is probably best used only as a fall back.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Cache-Control: This is the more modern replacement for the Expires header.</p>
<ul>
<li>It is well supported and implements a much more flexible design.</li>
<li>In almost all cases, this is preferable to Expires, but it may not hurt to set both values.</li>
<li>We will discuss the specifics of the options you can set with Cache-Control a bit later.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Etag: The Etag header is used with cache validation.</p>
<ul>
<li>The origin can provide a unique Etag for an item when it initially serves the content.</li>
<li>When a cache needs to validate the content it has on-hand upon expiration, it can send back the Etag it has for the content.</li>
<li>The origin will either tell the cache that the content is the same, or send the updated content and new Etag</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Last-Modified: Specifies the last time that the item was modified.</p>
<ul>
<li>This may be used as part of the validation strategy to ensure fresh content.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Content-Length: This header is important to set when defining caching policies.</p>
<ul>
<li>Certain software will refuse to cache content if it does not know in advanced the size of the content</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Vary: A cache will use the requested host and the path to the resource as the key to store the cache item.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Vary header can be used to tell caches to pay attention to an additional header when deciding whether a request is for the same item.</li>
<li>Tells caches to key by the Accept-Encoding header as well, so that the cache will know to differentiate between compressed and uncompressed content.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="cache-control-flags">Cache-Control Flags</h2>
<p>Cache-Control options:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>no-cache: Specifies that any cached content must be re-validated on each request before being served to client.</p>
<ul>
<li>Contents is marked as stale immediately, but uses revalidation techniques to avoid re-downloading again</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>no-store: This instruction indicates that the content cannot be cached in any way.</p>
<ul>
<li>This is appropriate to set if the response represents sensitive data.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>public: This marks the content as public, meaning it can be cached by the browser and any intermediate caches.</p>
<ul>
<li>For requests that HTTP authentication, responses are marked private by default.</li>
<li>This header overrides that setting.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>More options can be found at <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Cache-Control" target="_blank">Cache Control</a></p>
<p>Options can be used in different ways to achieve various caching behavior.</p>
<h2 id="developing-a-caching-strategy">Developing a Caching Strategy</h2>
<p>Ideally everything would be cached and your servers would only be contacted to validate content occasionally.</p>
<p>This doesn&apos;t often happen in practice though, so you should try to set some sane caching policies that aim to balance between implementing long-term caching and responding to the demands of a changing site.</p>
<h2 id="common-issues-with-caching">Common Issues with Caching</h2>
<p>There are many situations where caching cannot or should not be implemented due to how the content is produced</p>
<ol>
<li>Dynamic content generated by users</li>
<li>Sensitive information such as banking information, etc.</li>
<li>Older versions of your content are already out even though new versions have been published.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="general-recommendations">General Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Specific directories for images, css, and shared content</p>
<ul>
<li>Placing content into dedicated directories will allow you to easily refer to them from any page on your site.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Use the same URL to refer to the same items</p>
<ul>
<li>Caches key off of both the host and the path to the content requested</li>
<li>Ensure that you refer to your content in the same way on all of your pages.</li>
<li>The previous recommendation makes this significantly easier.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Use CSS image sprites where possible</p>
<ul>
<li>Sprites for items like icons and navigation decrease the number of round trips needed to render your site</li>
<li>Allowing your site to cache that single sprite for a long time.</li>
<li>Use Single SVG file instead of multiple svg as well</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Host scripts and external resources locally where possible</p>
<ul>
<li>If you utilize javascript scripts and other external resources, consider hosting those resources on your own dedicated servers if the correct headers are not being provided upstream.</li>
<li>Keep up to date with downstream changes however so you can update your local copy</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Fingerprint cache items</p>
<ul>
<li>For static content like CSS and Javascript files, it may be appropriate to fingerprint each item.</li>
<li>This means adding a unique identifier to the filename (often a hash of the file) so that if the resource is modified, the new resource name can be requested, causing the requests to correctly bypass the cache.</li>
<li>There are a variety of tools that can assist in creating fingerprints and modifying the references to them within HTML documents.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Allow all caches to store generic assets</p>
<ul>
<li>Static content and content that is not user-specific should be cached at all points in the delivery chain.</li>
<li>This will allow intermediary caches to respond with the content for multiple users.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Allow browsers to cache user-specific assets</p>
<ul>
<li>For per-user content, it is often acceptable and useful to allow caching within the user&apos;s browser.</li>
<li>Caching in the browser will allow for instant retrieval for users during subsequent visits.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Make exceptions for essential time-sensitive content</p>
<ul>
<li>Sites that have a shopping cart should reflect the items in the cart immediately.<ul>
<li>The no-cache or no-store options can be set in the Cache-Control header to achieve this.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Always provide validators</p>
<ul>
<li>Validators allow stale content to be refreshed without having to download the entire resource again.</li>
<li>Setting the Etag and the Last-Modified headers allow caches to validate their content and re-serve it if it has not been modified at the origin, further reducing load.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Set long freshness times for supporting content</p>
<ul>
<li>Items like images and css that don&apos;t change often</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Set short freshness times for parent content</p>
<ul>
<li>The HTML itself will be downloaded frequently, allowing it to respond to changes rapidly.</li>
<li>The supporting content can then be cached aggressively.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The key is to strike a balance that favors aggressive caching where possible while leaving opportunities to invalidate entries in the future when changes are made.</strong></p>
<p>Each Site will likely have the following items:</p>
<ol>
<li>Aggressively cached items</li>
<li>Cached items with a short freshness time and the ability to re-validate</li>
<li>Items that should not be cached at all</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>The goal is to move content into the first and second category when possible while maintaining an acceptable level of accuracy.</strong></p>
